The QR Code Generator is a web-based tool that converts text input into a QR (Quick Response) code. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, users can input text into a form field, and the application generates a QR code representing the input text. JavaScript utilizes libraries like qrcode.js to dynamically generate the QR code based on user input. Users can then download or share the generated QR code for various purposes, such as sharing text-based information, website URLs, or contact details in a convenient and accessible format. This tool simplifies the process of creating QR codes from text and enhances communication and information sharing.
